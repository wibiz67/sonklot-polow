 * 1. Provide a link back to the original repository (this repository), as

 *      wherever the source is being reproduced.  For example, should you

 *
 * 2. Retain these three comments:  the GNU GPL license statement, this comment,
 *      and that below it, that details the author and purpose.
 *
 * Failure to follow these terms will result in me getting very angry at you
 * and having your software tweaked or removed if possible.  Either way, you're
 * still an idiot for not following such a basic rule, so at least I'll have
 * that going for me.
